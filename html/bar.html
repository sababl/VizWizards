          This chart displays the average CO₂ emissions by country from 2001 to 2010, showing considerable variation
          across different nations. Aruba and Bahrain stand out with notably high emissions, with Aruba reaching the
          highest levels among the countries represented. In contrast, many countries such as Afghanistan and Bangladesh
          display minimal emissions, indicating lower industrial activity or stricter environmental regulations. The
          data suggests a significant disparity in CO₂ contributions, highlighting regions with potential environmental
          impact challenges.
